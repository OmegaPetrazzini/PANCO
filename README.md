# PANCO

PANCO allows PAthogenicity prediction of Non-COding variants using a combination of functional and evolutionary features fitted on a Gradient Boosted Trees model.

Pre-computed PANCO predictions for all possible non-coding variants in dbNSFP are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5745849.


To compute your own PANCO predictions please follow these instructions:

1) Annotated all features using ANNOVAR[], please see https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/.

2) Remove variants high >66% missing values and impute the remaining using NAsImpute[].

3) Download PANCO (PANCO.RDS) from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5745849.

4) Import your imputed dataset and PANCO into an R session.

```
library(data.table)
library(caret)

fit_model = readRDS("/path/PANCO.RDS")
MYDATA = fread("/path/MYDATA.txt", data.table = FALSE)
```

5) Make sure feature names match.
```
colnames(fit_model$trainingData)[which(!colnames(fit_model$trainingData) %in% colnames(I))]
```

6) No scaling is requiered so just predict.
```
Y = predict(fit_model, MYDATA, type = "prob")
```

Details on how PANCO was built will be made available at publication -
